# FISH FORECASTER
A fisherman's web application that allows the user to record weather conditions, water conditions, date and time of where they caught their biggest hauls.  Then the user can look back and correlate when and where the best fishing will be at.

Project is interrupted by jcswanson.com development, so this project is 1/2 done, so is currently in development. I still need to create functionality for saving the data gleamed from the APIs to the MySQL database and then develop an algorithm to correlate best fishing location for specific conditions. 

### Utilized Open Source APIs: 
- StormGlass: used to gather water temperature, wave height, current direction, tide, and biochemical conditions
- Google Geolocation: places a map with a marker when a user enters his/her's fishing location GPS coordinates 
- OpenWeather: used to gather atmospheric weather data
